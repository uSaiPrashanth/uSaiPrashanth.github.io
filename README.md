This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

To deploy your Next.js app on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Build and export your app as static files:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run export
   ```

2. Commit and push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   git push origin `git subtree split --prefix out main`:gh-pages --force
   ```

3. Go to the repository settings on GitHub, and under the "Pages" section, set the source to the `gh-pages` branch.

Your app should now be live on GitHub Pages.
